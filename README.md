# UI-God
UI-God is originally a web-based CSS and JS and PHP, allowing a fast and simple website creation while still maintaining room for creativity. Things to consider; 
1. The library should be responsive
2. The code should be tested before being uploaded to the repository
3. The library can only be used once a satisfying working version is complete. Nothing more, nothing less. 
4. Every day, 3 hours will be devoted to this project with clear goals.

In the end, this is my Legacy, this is what it will take to create stunning UIs and UX designs, responsive and robust web apps, as well as desktop apps and android apps.
