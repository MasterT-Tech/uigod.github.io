# UI-God
UI-God is originally a web based CSS and JS library so as to allow easy use of website creation while still maintaining room for creativity. Things to consider, the library should be responsive, the code should be tested before uploaded to the repository, the library can only be used once a satisfying working version is complete. Nothing more, nothing less. Every day, 3 hours will become devoted to this project with clear goals.
