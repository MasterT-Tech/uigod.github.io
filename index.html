<!--The index.html also serves as a tutorial, if you don't know the basics of html then I suggest you go learn that first
before we move on, also while having a clear knowledge basis on CSS, JS & PHP helps, it is infact not necessary, you might only have to 
use it when you really need to make your own personal edits to your design. Lets continue-->

	Noindex: Tells a search engine not to index a page.

	Index: Tells a search engine to index a page. Note that you donâ€™t need to add this meta tag; itâ€™s the default.

 	Nofollow: Tells a crawler not to follow any links on a page or pass along any link equity.

	Follow: Even if the page isnâ€™t indexed, the crawler should follow all the links on a page and pass equity to the linked pages.

    	Noimageindex: Tells a crawler not to index any images on a page.

    	None: Equivalent to using both the noindex and nofollow tags simultaneously.

    	Noarchive: Search engines should not show a cached link to this page on a SERP.

    	Nocache: Same as noarchive, but only used by Internet Explorer and Firefox.

    	Nosnippet: Tells a search engine not to show a snippet of this page (i.e. meta description) of this page on a SERP.

    	Noodyp/noydir [OBSOLETE]: Prevents search engines from using a pageâ€™s DMOZ description as the SERP snippet for this page. However, 
	DMOZ was retired in early 2017, making this tag obsolete.

    	Unavailable_after: Search engines should no longer index this page after a particular date.-->
